Moreover, some terms do not quite match what would be considered the intuitive definition. Finally, I went through every single term in (1) the bank of the science teacher identity terms in Section 2 and (2) the science teacher identity terms by research article in Section 3. It is worth mentioning that we will not be using every single term in the ontology, as there are many redundant, repetitive, or unclear terms. Cluster 1: Realizable Entity --> Specifically Dependent Continuant1A: Role1.

Rodgers and Scott (2008) – Chapter 40: The development of the personal self and professional identity in learning to teach (in Handbook of Research on Teacher Education)Teacher Identity (note that it is general in nature – not specific to science teachers and is a conceptual/theoretical type of paper): This is a handbook chapter that is conceptual in nature and on general teacher identity. One of the sections is the distinction between “Self” and “Identity” and the definitions provided. They offer conceptions of teacher identity and teacher self and then their new definitions. They define “self to subsume teacher identities and to be an evolving, yet, coherent being that consciously and unconsciously constructs and is constructed, reconstructs and is reconstructed in interaction with cultural contexts, institutions, and people with which the self lives, learns, and functions” (p. 751). There are also connections to emotions, to context of teaching, to experiences that inform meaning making. Psychological literature and developmental theory are referenced, along with Kegan (1982, 1994) and Gee (2000), which are other theoretical perspectives on the self and identity.Relevant terms:1. Identity: the shifting, unstable and multiple construction and reconstruction of meaning through stories and in relationships and emotions within social, cultural, political and historical contexts.   (p. 733)2. Awareness: a reflective process of making sense of the normative contextual and relational forces that shape identities. (p. 737)3. Voice: not having others speak for, or being silenced by others; being the author of one’s identity. (P. 737) 4. Self: an evolving yet coherent being, that consciously and unconsciously constructs and is constructed, and reconstructs and is reconstructed in interactions with culture, institution and people.  Self is an organized system of meaning and meaning making; it is both an entity and process that gives rise to identities (p. 739).5. Instrumental knower: a stage in how teachers make sense of their identities based on Kegan’s constructive-developmental theory of self characterized by concrete operations orientation  (p.740).6. Socializing knower: a stage in how a stage in how teachers make sense of their identities based on Kegan’s constructive-developmental theory of self characterized by interpersonal concordance orientation (p.740).7. Self-authoring knower: a stage in how teachers make sense of their identities based on Kegan’s constructive-developmental theory of self characterized by societal orientation  (p.741).6. Gee (2000/2001) – Chapter 3: Identity as an Analytic Lens for Research in EducationIdentity Theoretical Paper (not specific to teachers nor science teachers, though some science examples are provided in the text): This is another paper based on theory, but it is on identity in general (targeted for education researchers) and mostly taken up by educational researchers, especially those drawing upon sociocultural theories. The emphasis here is on relationality. Gee underscores recognition, connections to power and networks in legitimizing identities. He offers 4 Ways to View Identity; note that even though nature is considered by forces in nature, if you read the article, you’ll see the tensions there with the examples of African American racial identity as socially constructed – this kind of aligns with our discussion on gender and the continuum of interpretations from more biological and stable to socially constructed and performative, influenced and recognized differently according to context, etc. (e.g., our discussion re: Judith Butler on gender today). Gee’s is one of many frameworks taken up by education researchers for studying identity (other articles are in our UBbox folder).1. Identities: Being recognized as a certain "kind of person," in a given context (Gee, 2001, p. 99).  2. Nature identity (N-identity): a state developed from forces in nature (Gee, 2001, p. 100). Eg. A 3. Institution identity (I-identity): a position developed from authorities within institutions (Gee, 2001, p. 100). Eg. A professor4. Discourse identity (D-identity): an individual trait recognized in discourse/dialogue of/with “rational” individuals. (Gee, 2001, p. 100). Eg. Charismatic person5. Affinity identity (A-identity): an experience shared in the practice of “an affinity group”. (Gee, 2001, p. 100). Eg. Student teacher7. Beijaard, Verloop, and Vermunt (2000) – Teachers' perceptions of professional identity: An exploratory study from a personal knowledge perspectiveTeacher Professional Identity (note not specific to science teachers but includes the “professional” instead of only “teacher identity”): This is a study on secondary school teachers’ current and prior perceptions of their professional identity (not specific to science teachers). The questionnaire includes how teachers see themselves as subject matter experts, didactical experts, and pedagogical experts. They identified 5 “groups” of teachers with different learning experiences, and they also identified how these perceptions of their professional identity at the moment differed from prior perceptions from when they were beginning teachers (change over time), and that this change different across subject areas. Note that there is another article to check out, also cited in Hanna et al. (2019) and in our folder by Beijaard et al. (2004): Reconsidering research on teachers' professional identity, which would be worthwhile to review. It is a review of research on teacher professional identity, with a focus on teacher professional identity formation, characteristics of teachers’ professional identity, and studies in which professional identity was represented in teachers’ stories. They found differences in definitions of professional identity, if it was even defined. 1. Subject matter expert: a teacher who bases his/her profession on subject matter knowledge and skills. (p. 754)2. Didactical expert: a teacher who bases his/her profession on knowledge and skills regarding the planning, execution, and evaluation of teaching and learning processes. (p. 754)3. Pedagogical expert: a teacher who bases his/her profession on knowledge and skills to support students' social, emotional, and moral development. (p. 755)4. Teaching context: an identity influencing factor related to the ecology of the classroom and the culture of the school. (p. 752) eg. Teacher collaboration5. Teaching experience: an identity influencing factor related to the degree of expertise related to classroom instruction. (p. 753). Eg. I have developed a personal teaching style. 6. Biography: an identity influencing factor related to teachers’ personal life experiences (p. 753). E.g. learning from other experienced teachers. 8. Feser & Haak (2022) – Key features of teacher identity: a systematic meta-review study with special focus on teachers of science or science-related subjectsSystematic Literature Review on Teacher Identity but a Focus on Science Teachers and Teachers of Science-Related Subjects: This is a meta-review of 24 literature reviews on teacher identity, and they identified 30 key features of teacher identity (in general). Some of these features are from literature reviews that are on specifically science teachers. Feser & Haak (2022) emphasize that identity of science teachers differs from teachers of other subjects or generalist teachers. Check out Figure 1 on page 292 and the discussion beforehand (about a paragraph each) on personal, social, and collective identity. Also check page 309, Figure 4 on the “Key Features of Teacher Identity” as this might be helpful for thinking about the ontology and anything that is missing as well.1. Personal identity: a result of personal attributes such as knowledge, beliefs, interests, memories, self-images, emotions, as well as physical appearance and biology. (p. 291)2. Social identity: a result of individuals’ social interactions with others.  (291). 3. Collective identity: a result of memberships to a group, also called group identity, social identity. (p. 294)9. Rushton and Reiss (2021) citing Haslam (2017) – Middle and high school science teacher identitySystematic Literature Review on Science Teacher Identity Using a Social Identity Approach Theoretical Lens: This is a systematic literature review on science teacher identity, but they argue for the social identity approach theoretical lens to be adopted for understanding middle and high school science teacher identity. Specifically, they highlight the shared identity/group membership identity (and its social construction) and mention professional identity. Here is the Haslam reference that Rushton and Reiss cite/refer to as can be seen below (though they have 2 other Haslam and colleagues’ books): Haslam, S. A. (2017). The social identity approach to education and learning: Identification, ideation, interaction, influence and ideology. In K. I. Mavor, M. J. Platow, & B. Bizumic (Eds.), Self and social identity in educational contexts (pp. 19–52). Routledge.1. Social identity: ‘the individual’s knowledge that he [or she] belongs to certain social groups together with some emotional and value significance to him [or her] of this group membership’. (Haslam, 2017, p. 25)2. Identification: the extent social membership is internalized into the sense of self. (p. 144) 3. Ideation: group norms, or informal rules and guidelines, shape an individual’s social identity. (p. 144).  The ideational content of social identity in terms of its values, norms, morals and goals? (Haslam, 2017, 28)4. Interaction: a process to develop and galvanize social identities; it shapes the extent to which individuals feel part of the group and therefore can increase or limit their academic and intellectual performance. (p. 144) by the way social identities are lived out as well as by the way in which particular environments allow them to be lived out (or not) as a consequence of their identity affordance. (Haslam, 2017, p. 32)5. Influence: the extent to which leaders can shape the attitudes, intentions and behavior of followers. (p. 144) Capacity for people to shape educational and learning outcomes of others (Haslam, 2017, p. 34)6. Ideology: the context for identification,  ideation  and interaction for social identity in terms of multiple aspects of the educational landscape (e.g., class, political views, gender, “race”, faith). (p. 144)10. Avraamidou (2014) – Studying science teacher identity: current insights and future research directionsLiterature Review on Science Teacher Identity: This review looks at science teacher identity articles and finds commonalities there along with gaps in the literature on science teacher identity and identity development. Some of the gaps include the performance/observational piece or studying teacher identity as a process; a need for large-scale quantitative and longitudinal studies, and the role of context in science teacher identity. We have an updated scoping review of science teacher identity that shares some of the progress that has been made: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40594-024-00481-8?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20240401&utm_content=10.1186/s40594-024-00481-8#additional-information. You’ll see some references to “social justice science teacher identity” and “Teacher of Color” identity (e.g., Chen & Mensah, 2022; Varelas et al., 2023), or “reform-minded teacher identity” that would be important to include in the ontology as well. Avraamidou also has a 2016 book on science teacher identity: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-6300-528-9. 1. Meaning: a way of talking about our ability to experience our life and the world as meaningful (p. 148)2. Practice: a way of talking about the shared historical and social perspectives that can sustain mutual engagement in action. (p. 148)3. Community: a way of talking about the social configurations in which our enterprises are defined as worth pursuing. (p. 148)4. Identity: a way of talking about how learning changes who we are and creates personal histories of becoming in the context of our communities. (p. 148)5. Narrative: a three-dimensional space structure consisting of interaction, continuity, and situation.  Interaction refers to personal and social experiences; continuity refers to past, present and future; situation refers to the context where events take place and experiences take hold (p. 148-149). 6. Positional identities: the day-to-day and on-the-ground relations of power, deference and entitlement, social affiliation and distance – with the social-interactional, social-relational structures of the lived world. (p. 149).11. Munfaridah et al. (2021) (drawing from Hazari et al. (2010)): Preservice Physics Teachers’ Development of Physics Identities: the Role of Multiple RepresentationsPreservice Physics Teachers’ Physics Identities: Note that the participants are preservice physics teachers but the focus is on their “physics identity” – a disciplinary science identity as opposed to their “teacher identity” or their “physics teacher identity” or even a “preservice physics teacher identity.” Here, they are focusing on development, albeit in a short time through multiple representations as an instructional approach in Indonesia. Note that the interest, performance, competence, and recognition are from Hazari et al. (2010), which has been built upon in Hazari et al. (2020) to include performance/competence as combined and another dimension of belonging. There have been a number of other studies on math identity, engineering identity that have similarly drawn upon this framing. We can think of how this relates to Helms (1998) which talked about subject matter identity (like disciplinary identity) in relation to the science teacher identity. That is, how is science identity related to science teacher identity and all of the other types noted above?1. Performance: belief in ability to perform required physics tasks: frequency of individual activities in the classroom such as “getting involved in the small group discussion”.  (p. 1706)2. Interest: desire and curiosity to think about and understand physics: how interesting they find physics topics, and the activities in doing science or physics. (P. 1707)3. Recognition: how others consider oneself as being a physics person: how do you see yourself as “a physics person”, how do your parents/relatives/friends see yourself as “a physics person”?, and (c) how does your teacher see yourself as “a physics person”? (P. 1707)4. Competence: belief in ability to understand physics content. (Hazari et al. 2010, p. 982)12. Forbes & Davis (2008) - The Development of Preservice Elementary Teachers’ Curricular Role Identity for Science TeachingEmpirical Journal Article on Preservice Elementary Teachers and Science Teaching: The purpose of this article is to better understand how preservice elementary teachers construct a teaching identity as they learn to use science curriculum materials. We know that elementary teachers often only have one science course in their preparation, focus more on literacy and reading as they are more comfortable with it (and exacerbated by standardized testing and other pressures, etc.). Some key points from the article are the differences between preservice teachers and experienced elementary teachers’ curricular role identity for science teaching; their role standard (Collier, 2001; Stets & Burke, 2000) – kind of like a comparison against others, and translating these role standards into designated identities (Sfard & Prusak, 2005); curricular role identity being a composite of multiple activities teachers engage in – that construction of that role identity is multidimensional; interactions with science curriculum materials promote curriculum-specific role identity construction; and curricular role development is subject to meaning-making across these activities. If you’re interested in role identity, check out the DSMRI framework (another theoretical framework); see Kaplan and Garner (2017). Hathcock et al. (2020) also utilizes this framework specifically for micro-changes within science teachers’ identities.1. Role identity: how teachers fashion a sense of self around the role of teacher (p. 911).2. Curriculum role identity: a conception of preservice teachers themselves as elementary teachers in which the use of science curriculum materials is a valued dimension of science-teaching practice (p. 909). It has four dimensions: (a) Curricular role identity for general use of science curriculum materials, (b) Curricular role identity for scientific inquiry, (c) Curricular role identity for curriculum materials’ use in c, and (d) Curricular role identity for teacher learning from curriculum materials. (p. 933-932)13. Badia & Iglesias (2019) – The science teacher identity and the use of technology in the classroomEmpirical Study on Science Teacher Identity (Secondary Settings but also notes technology-enhanced learning…which has implications as we think about STEM…): Study on science teacher identity in secondary schools, looking at components of this identity and use of technology in education, along with types of science teacher identities. The context is Utah, USA. They specifically look at conceptions of teaching and learning, conceptions of the nature of science, their feelings about technology, competence in using technology, and frequency of classroom technology use. Three clusters of teachers were identified: (1) Agree with constructivism-Disagree with instructivism teachers; (2) Strongly agree with constructivism-1 Strongly disagree with instructivism teachers; and (3) Strongly agree with constructivism-Undecided about instructivism teachers. ***This makes me think about what some teachers we interviewed said about science equipment competencies and association with active learning teaching strategies, etc. 1. Instructivist conception of teaching: instruction means transferring content and concepts, and learning means copying an external reality in the minds of the students. (p. 533)2. Constructivist conception of teaching: creating powerful learning contexts to promote active knowledge construction by the learner and which is often implemented using inquiry-based science practices. (p. 533)3. Conceptions of science instruction and learning: a four-conception space: teacher helps students change science conceptions, the teacher helps students develop science conceptions, the teacher helps students acquire science teacher knowledge, and teacher helps students acquire science conceptions from the syllabus. (P. 533)4. Nature of science: “the epistemology of science, science as a way of knowing, or the values and beliefs inherent to scientific knowledge and its development.” (p. 533)5. Teacher competence in technology use: handling and using a computer as well as basic and advanced computer applications, and the skills that teachers use to appropriately employ technological resources in planning and implementing instructional practice in the classroom. (p. 534)6. Feeling and emotion regarding technology use: the teachers’ positive or negative feelings about technology use. (p. 534) 7. Use of technology for teaching and learning: frequency of use of technology in teaching and learning in classrooms (p. 536). 14.

The focus on this paper is understanding their transition process into becoming teachers, aligning with the profession, and how they navigated preparation program and school contexts. They mention identity resources that shape identity (contribute to its development): coursework, field experiences, and social contexts. They also see that the purpose for their change into teaching is to contribute to society. There is a connection between the teacher one aspires to and the learning environment/resources/supports. For another perspective on resources and identities, moreso with students’ identities than teachers’ identities, see Nasir & Cooks (2009) – this framing has been taken up more in math identity than in science, but it might be interesting and relate (again, not so much seen in teacher identity research); Nasir & Cooks point out 3 types of identity resources: material, relational, and ideational. Briefly, from Nasir & Cooks (2009): “By material resources, we mean the way in which the physical environment, its organization, and the artifacts in it support one's sense of connection to the practice. Relational resources refer to the positive relationships with others in the context that can increase connection to the practice. Ideational resources refer to the ideas about oneself and one's relationship to and place in the practice and the world, as well as ideas about what is valued or good” (p. 47) and they go on to discuss this more.1. Identity resources: factors that support preservice teacher professional identity development. It includes professional resources and personal resources. Professional resources include competences (i.e., content knowledge, PCK, technological knowledge, teaching practice and transferring skills from previous career), and learning environment (i..e, teamwork and diverse learning environment). Personal resources include personal beliefs that can enhance personal ideals and understanding teachers’ role.  (p. 7).
