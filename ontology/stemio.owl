The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)"@en ;

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops.

In psychology, memory is the processes by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved.  Encoding allows information that is from the outside world to reach our senses in the forms of chemical and physical stimuli.  In this first stage we must change the information so that we may put the memory into the encoding process.  Storage is the second memory stage or process.  This entails that we maintain information over periods of time.  Finally the third process is retrieval.  This is the retrieval of information that we have stored. We must locate it and return it to our consciousness.  Some retrieval attempts may be effortless due to the type of information.

From an information processing perspective there are three main stages in the formation and retrieval of memory:

1. Encoding or registration (receiving, processing and combining of received information)
2. Storage (creation of a permanent record of the encoded information)
3. Retrieval, recall or recollection (calling back the stored information in response to some cue for use in a process or activity)

Declarative memory (sometimes referred to as explicit memory) is one of two types of long term human memory.  It refers to memories which can be consciously recalled such as facts and knowledge.  Its counterpart is known as non-declarative or Procedural memory, which refers to unconscious memories such as skills (e.g. learning to ride a bicycle).  Declarative memory can be divided into two categories: episodic memory which stores specific personal experiences and semantic memory which stores factual information.

There are two types of declarative memory.  Semantic memories are those that store general factual knowledge that is independent of personal experience.  Examples include types of food, capital cities, lexical knowledge (vocabulary), etc.  Episodic memories are those that store specific events such as attending a class or flying to France. Retrieval of these memories can be thought of as mentally reliving the past events they concern.  Episodic memory is believed to be the system that provides the basic support for semantic memory.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_memory:

Explicit memory is the conscious, intentional recollection of previous experiences and information.  People use explicit memory throughout the day, such as remembering the time of an appointment or recollecting an event from years ago.  Explicit memory involves conscious recollection, compared with implicit memory which is an unconscious, unintentional form of memory.  Remembering a specific driving lesson is an example of explicit memory, while improved driving skill as a result of the lesson is an example of implicit memory."""@en ;

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory:

Working memory has been defined as the system which actively holds information in the mind to do verbal and nonverbal tasks such as reasoning and comprehension, and to make it available for further information processing.  Working memory tasks are those that require the goal-oriented active monitoring or manipulation of information or behaviors in the face of interfering processes and distractions.  Working memory can only retain a limited amount of information; however, its capacity can be increased by use of a method known as chunking.  The cognitive processes involved include the executive and attention control of short-term memory which provide for the interim integration, processing, disposal, and retrieval of information.  These processes are sensitive to age; working memory is associated with cognitive development and research shows that its capacity tends to decline with old age.  Working memory is a theoretical concept central both to cognitive psychology and neuroscience.  In addition, studies done on a neurobiological basis have proven that working memory can be linked to learning and attention.

Theories exist both regarding the theoretical structure of working memory and the role of specific parts of the brain involved in working memory.  Research identifies the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate, and parts of the basal ganglia as crucial.  The neural basis of working memory has been derived from lesion experiments in animals and functional imaging upon humans."""@en ;

Recall in memory refers to the retrieval of events or information from the past.  Along with encoding and storage, it is one of the three core processes of memory. There are three main types of recall: free recall, cued recall and serial recall.  Psychologists test these forms of recall as a way to study the memory processes of humans and animals.  Two main theories of the process of recall are the Two-Stage Theory and the theory of Encoding Specificity.

The Austin Simonson theory states that the process of recall begins with a search and retrieval process, and then a decision or recognition process where the correct information is chosen from what has been retrieved.  In this theory, recognition only involves the latter of these two stages, or processes, and this is thought to account for the superiority of the recognition process over recall.  Recognition only involves one process in which error or failure may occur, while recall involves two.  However, recall has been found to be superior to recognition in some cases, such as a failure to recognize words that can later be recalled.

The theory of encoding specificity finds similarities between the process of recognition and that of recall.  The encoding specificity principle states that memory utilizes information from the memory trace, or the situation in which it was learned, and from the environment in which it is retrieved.  Encoding specificity helps to take into account context cues because of its focus on the retrieval environment, and it also accounts for the fact recognition may not always be superior to recall.

Recognition memory is a subcategory of declarative memory.  Essentially, recognition memory is the ability to recognize previously encountered events, objects, or people. When the previously experienced event is reexperienced, this environmental content is matched to stored memory representations, eliciting matching signals.  Recognition memory can be subdivided into two component processes: recollection and familiarity, sometimes referred to as \"remembering\" and \"knowing\", respectively.  Recollection is the retrieval of details associated with the previously experienced event.  In contrast, familiarity is the feeling that the event was previously experienced, without recollection.  Thus, the fundamental distinction between the two processes is that recollection is a slow, controlled search process, whereas familiarity is a fast, automatic process.

Mandler's \"Butcher-on-the-bus\" example:

Imagine taking a seat on a crowded bus.  You look to your left and notice a man.  Immediately, you are overcome with this sense that you've seen this man before, but you cannot remember who he is.  This automatically elicited feeling is familiarity. While trying to remember who this man is, you begin retrieving specific details about your previous encounter.  For example, you might remember that this man handed you a fine chop of meat in the grocery store.  Or perhaps you remember him wearing an apron.  This search process is recollection."""@en ;

A motor skill is a learned sequence of movements that combine to produce a smooth, efficient action in order to master a particular task.  The development of motor skill occurs in the motor cortex, the region of the cerebral cortex that controls voluntary muscle groups.  The stages to motor learning is the cognitive phase, the associative phase, and the autonomous phase.

Cognitive Phase: When a learner is new to a specific task, the primary thought process starts with, “what needs to be done?”  Considerable cognitive activity is required so that the learner can determine appropriate strategies to adequately reflect the desired goal.  Good strategies are retained and inefficient strategies are discarded.  The performance is greatly improved in a short amount of time.

Associative Phase: the learner has determined the most effective way to do the task and starts to make subtle adjustments in performance.  Improvements are more gradual and movements become more consistent.  This phase can last for a long time.

Autonomous Phase: this phase may take several months to years to reach.  The phase is dubbed because the performer can now “automatically” complete the task without having to pay any attention to it.  Examples include walking and talking or sight reading while doing simple arithmetic."""@en ;

Episodic memory, a part of autobiographical memory, consists of the recollection of events in the life of a person.  These can be memories that happened to the person directly or just be memories of events that happened around them.  Simply put, it is the memory of life experiences centered on oneself.  Episodic memory is necessary for \"time traveling\": remembering your past.  Episodic memory does not have any direct affect on how one imagines their future.  It is considered a uniquely human quality that depends on maturation and therefore won't be found in babies and young children.  For children, recollection of these memories can also be hindered by traumatic events that occur during childhood.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory:

Episodic memory is the memory of autobiographical events (times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual knowledge) that can be explicitly stated.  Semantic and episodic memory together make up the category of declarative memory, which is one of the two major divisions in memory.  Events that are recorded into episodic memory may trigger episodic learning, i.e. a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event.  For example, a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning.  One of the main components of episodic memory is the process of recollection."""@en ;

Examples of simple tasks include remembering to put the toothpaste cap back on, remembering to reply to an email or remembering to return a rented movie.  Examples of highly important situations include a patient remembering to take medication or a pilot remembering to perform specific safety procedures during a flight.

In contrast to prospective memory, retrospective memory involves memory of people, events and words that have been encountered in the past.  Prospective memory and retrospective memory differ in the fact that retrospective memory emphasizes memory for events that have previously occurred, while prospective memory focuses on intended future events and is thus considered a form of memory for the future.  Retrospective memory involves the memory of what we know, containing informational content; prospective memory focuses on when to act, without focusing on informational content.

Procedural memory is created through \"procedural learning\" or, repeating a complex activity over and over again until all of the relevant neural systems work together to automatically produce the activity.  Implicit procedural learning is essential to the development of any motor skill or cognitive activity."""@en ;

Wikipedia: Priming is an implicit memory effect in which exposure to a stimulus influences a response to a later stimulus.  It can occur following perceptual, semantic, or conceptual stimulus repetition.  For example, if a person reads a list of words including the word table, and is later asked to complete a word starting with tab, the probability that he or she will answer table is greater than if not so primed.  Another example is if people see an incomplete sketch that they are unable to identify and they are shown more of the sketch until they recognize the picture, later they will identify the sketch at an earlier stage than was possible for them the first time.  The effects of priming can be very salient and long lasting, even more so than simple recognition memory.  Unconscious priming effects can affect word choice on a word-stem completion test long after the words have been consciously forgotten.  Priming works best when the two stimuli are in the same modality. For example visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues. But priming also occurs between modalities, or between semantically related words such as 'doctor' and 'nurse'."""@en ;

From Wikipedia: The terms positive and negative priming refer to when priming affects the speed of processing.  A positive prime speeds up processing, while a negative prime lowers the speed to slower than un-primed levels.  Positive priming is caused by simply experiencing the stimulus, while negative priming is caused by experiencing the stimulus, and then ignoring it.  Positive priming effects happen even if the prime is not consciously seen.  The effects of positive and negative priming are visible in event-related potential (ERP) readings.""" ;

For example, one can consider oneself to be some certain gender without either wanting others to know or choosing to present oneself in a corresponding way. We distinguish (ii) and (iii) because one can prefer to be regarded some certain way without attempting to present oneself in any corresponding way."@en ;

During the process of planning out the words and what one intends to communicate, one is already concretizing words cognitively, as well as considering which combinations of words one can use to concretize additional generically dependent continuants.
